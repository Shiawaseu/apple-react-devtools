## About
An **unofficial port of the React Devtools** extension for Safari on AppleOS.
- This substitutes Facebook's [hacky](https://react.dev/learn/react-developer-tools#safari-and-other-browsers) solution for Safari, which only works on websites you develop as well as exclusivity in develeopment environments.

## Features

- Anything `React-Devtools` can do!
- Works natively in Safari on all Apple devices

---

## Installation
- You have the option to either:
  - Install the extension directly via the [Releases](https://github.com/Shiawaseu/apple-react-devtools/releases) tab
  - Clone and compile yourself

### 2. Launching the application (macOS)
- Since the application is not signed, you will receive a warning regarding security, you can ignore it in your settings (`System Settings > Privacy & Security`)
